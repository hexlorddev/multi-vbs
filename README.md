# 🚀 Ultimate VBScript Demonstration 🚀

This project is a comprehensive VBScript application designed to showcase a variety of system interactions, file manipulations, and utility functions. It serves as a practical example of VBScript's capabilities in automating tasks and managing system information on Windows environments.

---

## ✨ Features

The script offers a menu-driven interface with the following key functionalities:

*   💻 **System Information:** Retrieve and display details about the operating system, hardware, and network configuration.
*   📂 **File Operations:** Perform common file system tasks such as creating, deleting, copying, and moving files and folders.
*   ➕ **Math Calculator:** A simple calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
*   ✂️ **String Utilities:** Tools for manipulating and processing text strings.
*   📅 **Date and Time Functions:** Display current date/time and perform date calculations.
*   ⚙️ **Process Management:** List running processes and potentially manage them.
*   🌳 **Environment Variable Access:** View and modify system environment variables.
*   📝 **Logging:** Generate a log file (`vbscript_log.txt`) to record script activities and errors.
*   📄 **Output Generation:** Creates various output files like `sample.html`, `data.xml`, `report.csv`, and `demo.bat` based on user actions.

## 📁 Folder Structure

The project is organized to keep source code, generated files, and supporting documents separate and manageable:

*   **`src/`**: Contains the main VBScript source code. The primary script is `index.vbs`.
*   **`lib/`**: Holds any helper VBScript files or libraries that might be used by the main scripts.
*   **`output/`**: This is where all files generated by the script are stored.
*   **`logs/`**: Contains log files, primarily `vbscript_log.txt`, which records the script's operations.
*   **`docs/`**: Includes documentation for the project, explaining setup, usage, and other relevant details.
*   **`utils/`**: Stores utility scripts that are not part of the main application's generation process but might be helpful for development, maintenance, or batch operations.
*   **`data/`**: Contains sample data files that the VBScript might use as input.
*   **`scripts/`**: Houses utility scripts for build, deployment, or other automation tasks related to the project itself.
*   **`tests/`**: Contains test scripts for the VBScript code.

## ▶️ How to Run

1.  Navigate to the `src/` folder in your command prompt or file explorer.
2.  Execute the main script using `cscript index.vbs`.
3.  Alternatively, you can often run the script by double-clicking `index.vbs` if your system is configured to execute VBScript files with `wscript.exe` (though `cscript.exe` is recommended for console output).

## 📄 Generated Files

The script generates various files based on its operations:

*   **In `output/` folder:**
    *   `sample.html`: An example HTML file.
    *   `data.xml`: An example XML data file.
    *   `report.csv`: A sample CSV report.
    *   `demo.bat`: A demonstration batch file.
*   **In `logs/` folder:**
    *   `vbscript_log.txt`: A log of script activities, errors, and significant events.
